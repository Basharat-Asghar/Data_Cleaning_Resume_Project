Introduction:
Data cleaning is a vital step in any data analysis project, as it involves inspecting, transforming, and validating
the data to ensure its quality and accuracy. In this article, I will share my experience of completing a data cleaning
challenge using Excel and Power Query on a FIFA 21 dataset. The dataset contains information about the performance and
attributes of football players. I will demonstrate how I used various techniques such as splitting columns,
converting data types, and calculating new columns to clean and transform the data.

Scenario:
The challenge I faced while cleaning the FIFA 21 dataset was dealing with special characters and inconsistent formats
in some columns. For example, the name, long name, nationality, and club columns had some characters that were not in
the standard ASCII range. The Ova column name had a special character. The contract column had both the start and end
dates combined, and some players had missing dates, with some players having only year value as the contract
date and other players having a contract in this format "Jan 12, 2021, On loan", and some have value as free.
The position column had multiple positions separated by commas for players. The height and weight columns had both metric
and imperial units, such as 175cm or 5’9" and 70kg or 154 lbs. The value, wage, and release clause columns
had text values that included currency symbols and suffixes such as K for thousand and M for million. The hits column
also had text values with K as a suffix for some numbers. The w/f, sm, and ir columns had numbers followed by stars,
such as 4★ or 3★.

1) One way to handle the special characters in the dataset is to change the file format to UTF-8, which can be done by
while selecting the file to transform in power query, which is a universal encoding standard that can support a wide
range of characters.
2) For the OVA column simply rename the column after changing the file format in the Power Query editor.
3) The next step to transform the dataset was to remove the stars from the W/F, SM, and IR columns, this indicated the
weak foot ability, skill moves, and international reputation of the players. To do this, I selected the columns and
clicked on Replace Values from the Home tab in the Transform section. A dialog box appeared where I entered * in the
"Value To Find" option and left the "Replace With" option empty. This replaced all the stars with blank spaces. Then I
changed the column type to Integer.
4) The next transformation I performed on the dataset was to clean the hits column, which had text values that
included K as a suffix for some numbers. To do this, I went to the Add Column tab and selected Custom Column.
I created a new column called Hits Cleaned by writing an M code in the editor that removed the K suffix and
multiplied the value by 1000 if it was present, otherwise same value.[formula] Then I removed the original hits column by right-clicking on it and
selecting Remove. I changed the new column type to Integer, and renamed the new column as Hits by double-clicking on it
and typing the new name.
5) Another transformation I applied to the dataset was to split the contract column, which had both the start
and end dates combined in one cell with a "~" symbol as a delimiter. To do this, I selected the contract column and went
to the Home tab. I clicked on Split Column and then on By Delimiter. A dialog box appeared where I chose Custom as the
delimiter and entered "~" in the box. This split the column into two new columns with the start and end dates.
I selected both columns and went to the Transform tab. I clicked on Format and then Trim, which removed any leading and
trailing spaces from the values. I added a custom column by writing an M code that extracts the year value from the
string.[formula] I also used Trim on that column to remove any spaces. I renamed the newly created column as Contract
Start and the other column as Contract End.
6) The next transformation I performed on the dataset was to clean the value, wage, and release clause columns,
These had text values including currency symbols and suffixes such as K for thousand and M for million. To do this,
I created new custom columns by writing M code that extracted the number from the string and multiplied it by 1000 if the
it ended with K or 1000000 if it ended with M.[formula] Changed the new column types to Integer.
I removed the original columns, and renamed the new columns as Value (€), Wage(€) and Release Clause(€).
7) Another transformation that I applied to the dataset was to convert the height column, which had values in both
centimeters and feet, such as 175cm, 5’9". To do this, I added a new custom column by writing an M code that converted
the values to centimeters who have values like 5'9" if not same value.[formula] Changed the new column type to Integer.
Then removed the original column, and renamed the new column as Height (cm).
8) For weight, the same process created a new custom column that converts values that are in "lbs" to "kg" by writing
M code if not same value.[formula] Changed column type to integer and removed the original column.Renamed the new column as Weight (kg)
9) Toward the end, I removed columns like Long Name as most people did not know their full name, Photo Url, Player Url,
Positions as they have multiple positions, because we have a Best Position column where players play at their finest.
10) For player names, I kept the Name column as this column has short names sufficient to recognize a player.
11) Other stats columns like BOV, POT, and OVA are kept as integers.
The OVA (Overall) rating is not directly considered as a percentage. It represents an overall rating of a player's
abilities and skills, typically on a scale from 0 to 99. The OVA rating is a numerical representation of a player's
overall performance and is used to evaluate and compare players in the game. It takes into account various attributes
and skills, such as speed, shooting, passing, dribbling, defending, and physicality.

BOV represents the best overall rating a player can achieve based on their current abilities and skills. It reflects the
player's peak performance level and is also typically on a scale from 0 to 99. Similar to OVA, the BOV rating is not
considered as a percentage but rather as a numerical representation of a player's overall quality.

POT, on the other hand, represents the player's potential rating, indicating their projected future development and
improvement. It reflects the maximum overall rating a player can reach with proper training and game time. Like OVA
and BOV, the POT rating is also represented as a numerical value, not as a percentage.

These ratings—OVA, BOV, and POT—provide a standardized way to evaluate and compare players in the FIFA game,
allowing players and managers to assess the quality, potential, and overall abilities of virtual footballers.
